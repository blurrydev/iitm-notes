# Backups

- **Full Backup:** Will backup everything.
- **Incremental Backup:** Will only back up the new changes.
- **Differential Backup:** Will backup everything that comes after a full backup.


- **RAID 0:** Here we will break the data and store it in different disks. This gives high performance.
- **RAID 1:** Here we will not break the data but mirror it and store it in another disk. This doesn't work for performance but works for availability.
- **RAID 1+0:** It is a combination of both RAID 1 and RAID 0.

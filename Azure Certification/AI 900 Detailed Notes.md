# The layers of Machine Learning

- **Artificial Intelligence:** When machines perform jobs that mimic human behavior.
- **Machine Learning:** Machines that get better at task without human intervention.
- **Deep Learning:** Machines that have ANN (Artificial Neural Network) inspired by human brain.
- **Data Scientist:** A person who is skilled in *Maths, stats, predictive modelling and ML* to make future predictions.

# Key Elements of AI

- **Machine Learning:** The foundation of an AI system to learn and predict like a human.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detect outliers or things just like a human.
- **Computer Vision:** When computer can see things and detect them like a human.
- **NLP:** To be able to process human language and confer text.
- **Conversational AI:** To able to hold a conversation with a human.

# Data Sets

- **Data Set:** A dataset is a logical grouping of units of data that are closely related and/or share the same data structure.
- **MNIST:** Dataset containing images of handwritten digits used to test Classification, Clustering and Image processing algorithms.
- **COCO (Common Objects in Context):**

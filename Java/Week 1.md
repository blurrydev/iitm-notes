### What is the difference between Interpreter and Compiler?

- A compiler translates our high level code into low level code in *one shot*.
- An interpreter translates our code *line by line* into low level code.

### Different types of Programming Language

#### Imperative
- Focuses on explicit instructions and step by step procedures.
- Programs specify how to achieve the result by declaring variables, control flow structure etc.
- Example: Java, C, C++

#### Declarative
- Emphasizes describing the desired outcome or result.
- Programs specify what is to be achieved rather than how to achieve it.
- Examples: SQL, HTML, CSS

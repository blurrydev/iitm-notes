# Network Flow

### Rules

1. There should not be any accumulation of entity in any point of the network.
2. Maximize the flow.
3. Follow capacity constraints.

It will be a directed graph and there will be a weight on the graph, that weight will be it's capacity and we cannot send more than that capacity through that edge.

### Possible Questions from this concept

1. Given a graph what will be the maximum possible flow?
2. Given a graph what can be the minimum cut?

To solve the first question we will be using:
